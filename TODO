Coding:
-Interface -> wrote class? revise 
-Contacts
-Globals
-Materials
-Opitcal
-Transport -> check, may need revision
-Potential
-Model -> check

Writing:
-Introduction -> Manufacturability, Efficiency
-Topics So Far:
	-Silvaco TCAD Atlas: too expensive, no student option
	-COMSOL: did not have necessary modules, too expensive for purchase
	-Devsim: open-source, python wrapper, pn examples (find others), 
	-Models:
		Scharfetter-Gummel, 
		Drift Diffusion, 
		Field-Dependent Mobility
	-Own library: different materials, modular -> easier setup

Coding:
-Interface -> check
-Transport -> check
-Potential -> check
-Model -> check
-Contacts -> check
-Globals -> In Progress
-Materials -> Research
-Optical -> Research

1/23/19
Coding:
-Interface
	-Potential -> continuous (pretty sure)
	-Electrons/Holes -> continous, but dependent on potential?
	_Light -> implement optical first hahaha
-Transport -> good!
-Potential -> good! may need to make changes for multiple materials?
-Model, Contacts, Global, Material -> Done
-Mobility, Optical -> implement and test

Writing:
-UNITS!!! CHECK YOUR UNITS (mobility/ Boltzmann Constant/ ElectricField)
-Look up what metal->uses same values as material contact is in
-devsim writes the value of last simulation, Visit normalizes output data so should be wary of what should be plotting against
-Edge -> ElementEdge (ElectricField -> ElectricFieldMag?)


1/30/19
Coding:
-Transport -> may want to add SCLC
-Mobility -> Working!, but need absolute on ElectricField!
-Optical-> still havent done
-Injection -> think of interplay between intrinsic potential and 
-Units -> Fixed!
-ElementEdge -> not yet necessary
-

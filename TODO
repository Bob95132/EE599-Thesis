Coding:
-Interface -> wrote class? revise 
-Contacts
-Globals
-Materials
-Opitcal
-Transport -> check, may need revision
-Potential
-Model -> check

Writing:
-Introduction -> Manufacturability, Efficiency
-Topics So Far:
	-Silvaco TCAD Atlas: too expensive, no student option
	-COMSOL: did not have necessary modules, too expensive for purchase
	-Devsim: open-source, python wrapper, pn examples (find others), 
	-Models:
		Scharfetter-Gummel, 
		Drift Diffusion, 
		Field-Dependent Mobility
	-Own library: different materials, modular -> easier setup
